This is a program developed to compare the combination of different search algorithms: 

First algorithm: Interpolation only
Second algorithm: First search with Interpolation, continue with Linear Search
Third algorithm: First search with Interpolation, continue with Binary Search
Fourth algorithm: First search with Interpolation, continue with Exponential Search
